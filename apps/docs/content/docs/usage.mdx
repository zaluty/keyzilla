## Usage

<Callout title="Heads up!" type="warn"> this guide assumes you have already [authenticated with Keyzilla](/docs/authentication)</Callout>
Keyzilla is built with TypeScript and on top of the [t3-env](https://github.com/t3-oss/env-nextjs) package.
This provides you with a type-safe `process.env` alternative, offering type safety and autocomplete right in your IDE.

First, pull the projects from the dashboard with:

```bash
npx keyzilla pull
```

You'll be prompted to choose between your personal projects or your organization's projects:

```bash
? Select a project type:
 > Personal
 > Organization
```

Then, you'll be prompted to select the specific project you want to pull:

```bash
? Select a project:
 > keyzilla
   react-project
   next-project
   the-unfinished-project
```

In this example, we'll select `keyzilla`.

This will pull the API keys and secrets and save them to a secret file in the `node_modules` directory of your project.

To use these keys across your project, you can access them through the `k` object:

```typescript
const apiKey = k.DATABASE_URL;
console.log(apiKey); // postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database
```
