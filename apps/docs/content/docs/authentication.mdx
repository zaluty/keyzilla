## Authentication

Once you have your secret key and email address, you can authenticate with the following command:

```bash
npx keyzilla login
```

You will be prompted to enter your email address and secret key:

```bash
Enter your email: 
 > your-email@example.com
Enter your secret key: 
 > your-secret-key
```
<Callout title="Title">Hello World</Callout>
## Logout

To logout, use the following command:

```bash
npx keyzilla logout
```

You will be prompted to confirm the logout:

```bash
Are you sure you want to logout?  
 > Yes  No
```

Choose "Yes" to confirm the logout.
