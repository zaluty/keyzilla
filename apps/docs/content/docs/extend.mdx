## Extend


Keyzilla was built with extensibility in mind. You can extend Keyzilla with your own custom configurations.

### What you can extend:

- Key values
- Key environments (server, client)

### What you cannot extend:

- Key names (to avoid conflicts)

### How to extend Keyzilla

1. Create a new file in the root of your project (optional). It's recommended to name it `keyzilla.config.ts`.

2. Use the `keyzillaExtend` function to modify existing keys or add new ones:

```js
import { keyzillaExtend  as extend} from 'keyzilla';

// Original configuration
console.log(k.DATABASE_URL); // Outputs: original value

// Extend the configuration
const k = extend({  
    "DATABASE_URL": {
        "value": "new value",
        "environments": "server"
    }
});

// New configuration
console.log(k.DATABASE_URL);  // Outputs: new value
```

To add a new key we recommende not using this package and instead use [t3-env](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env) directly as it is lighter and faster.

<Callout title="Note" type="error"> If the key you  are trying to extend dosent exist in the projects you will get an error     `Key does not exist in ${project.name}`	</Callout>
This example demonstrates how to change the value of an existing key (`DATABASE_URL`) and specify that it should only be available in the server environment.
