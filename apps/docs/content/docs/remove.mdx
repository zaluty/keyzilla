# Remove Keyzilla

If you've decided to remove Keyzila from your project, you can do so by running:

```bash
npx keyzila remove
```

Keyzila is designed to remove itself from your project without leaving any trace. But that's not all! The removal process also:

1. Removes the secret file from your `node_modules` folder
2. Creates a `.env.local` file in your project root
3. Adds all the keys you had in your project to the `.env.local` file
4. Replaces all instances of Keyzila key access in your code

For example, it will change:

```ts
const apiKey = k.DATABASE_URL
```

to:

```ts
const apiKey = process.env.DATABASE_URL || ""
```

OR 

```ts
const apiKey = import.meta.env.DATABASE_URL || ""
```

This ensures a smooth transition back to using environment variables directly.

If you encounter any issues with the Keyzilla package or the removal process, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/zaluty/keyzila/issues/new/choose).
