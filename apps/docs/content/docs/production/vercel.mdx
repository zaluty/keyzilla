## Using Keyzilla with Vercel

Keyzilla is designed to work seamlessly with Vercel deployments. It automatically detects your project's framework and environment (development or production) to use the appropriate method for accessing environment variables.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, navigate to the "Settings" tab.
2. Select "Environment Variables" from the left sidebar.
3. Add your Keyzilla-related environment variables here.

4. Add the following environment variables to Vercel

- `KEYZILLA_API_SECRET`
- `KEYZILLA_PROJECT_NAME`
- `KEYZILLA_ENV_TYPE`
  {" "}
  <Callout type="warn">
    Make sure to add all the environment variables to Vercel, so keyzilla can
    detect them. Don't change their names, use the same names from keyzilla
    dashboard.
  </Callout>

5. Add the prod commanf from keyzilla dashboard to your vercel build command.

{" "}

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to add the prod command to your vercel build command, so keyzilla
  can detect them. before the build command or whatever you use to build your
  project.
</Callout>

### How Keyzilla Uses Environment Variables

- In production, Keyzilla will use `process.env` for Node.js-based frameworks or `import.meta.env` for frameworks that support it.
- You don't need to modify your code or configuration; Keyzilla handles the detection and usage automatically.

For more information on managing environment variables in Vercel, refer to the [Vercel documentation on Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).
